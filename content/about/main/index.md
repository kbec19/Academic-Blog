intro: |
  After years of focus on operational legal management, I began researching new aspects of human resource analytics and changed my focus to executive HR management in 2020. The opportunity to focus on the social psychology aspect of my work paired with a love for statistical and computational studies led me back to academia. I resumed courses at UMass Amherst, where I got my B.A. through the UWW program, in the new DACSS (Data Analytics and Computation for Social Sciences) program. I loved it so much that I decided in January 2022 to engage full-time in completing my Master’s degree in the program and exploring new career paths. 
  
  My courses have developed and continue to grow my skills in qualitative and quantitative data analysis, survey methodology, research design, data visualization, political science, and social psychology. I also continue to grow my proficiency in the programming languages R and Python. My primary academic research interests include the prevention, onset, management, and resolution of conflict, combat veteran experiences and narratives and their role in society, the intersecting study of veterans and environmental justice. 
  
  I am currently engaging in diverse internships while I explore the right fit where my long-built and new-found knowledge bases serve a mutual need. I’m looking to connect with others pivoting to new phases in their educational and professional lives as well as those interested in engaging in building the support and knowledge resources of military veterans and their families, peace-building advocates, and anyone generally trying to find new ways to move the world forward.
