I am in the process of migrating my blog from distill to Hugo, and there is a steep learning curve.

### Secondary Project Sites

Hugo Ap√©ro is pretty, but I'm still getting through my to-do list on full implementation. I'm going to finish getting the framework set up, but until the full migration is complete, check out the project page for links to the existing GitHub pages and project sites to dig in further into my current projects.

### Getting Here

After beginning the quest to create an academic website with my DACSS program support in distill, I found I wanted to expand my content and Hugo seemed like the right fit. After a lot of trial and error, this template and its' implementation were made possible by finding [Alison Hill, PhD.](https://www.apreshill.com/project/hugo-apero/) by stumbling on her slides on [*Making Websites in R Markdown*](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/blogdown.html#1).
