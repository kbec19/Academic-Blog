Sometimes the best way to learn is to share what you know with someone else who knows as much or more than you do. This is what happened when I shared my shell of a blog in process with the fabulous [Isha Mahajan](https://github.com/Isha-Mahajan12). Really, starting to use th Hugo/Netlify/RStudio blog process is pretty simple.

1. Fork theme into your Github repository (https://github.com/hugo-apero/hugo-apero-docs for this theme)

2. Create a Netlify account

3. Connect your Netlify account to the blog repository in Github

4. Clone your repository and open a new project in RStudio for it (be sure you've installed the blogdown package and Hugo in RStudio: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)

5. Read the documentation and resources available, mess around, and build a cool blog. Connect it to your custom domain in Netlify if you'd like!
