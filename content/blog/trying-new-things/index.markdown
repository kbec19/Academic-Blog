I am attempting to migrate my blog from distill to Hugo, and there is a steep learning curve.

## Secondary Sites

Hugo Ap√©ro is pretty, but a bit tough to use as a first try at Hugo. I'm going to finish getting the framework set up, but until the full migration is complete, check out the project page for links to the existing GitHub pages and project sites to dig in further into my current projects.
