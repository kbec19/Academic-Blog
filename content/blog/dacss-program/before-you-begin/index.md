If you already are an expert in "R", "RStudio", and "GitHub", you are likely not in the place I was when I began the DACSS program, and bless you! For me, it took a lot of remedial catch-up work to become even remotely fluent in these new languages.

A few different entry points to understand a little about data are in this list, though not exhaustive and definitely not the final words on the matter!

## Background

## Understand the Elements of Your New Workflow

+ Complete these [installation instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html).
    
+ Test your connection between GitHub and RStudio following [these steps](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html). 
    
+ **NOTE:** Experts *strongly recommend* that if you are not already a fluent GitHub user you choose [HTTPS over SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html).

+ Read through as much as possible on [Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) to understand how Git, GitHub, R, and RStudio and how they all work together.

## Installations

After installing Git/GitHub/R/RStudio, there are some packages you will use from the beginning, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:

    ```r
    > install.packages(c("usethis", "remotes", "distill", 
                       "postcards", "here", "tidyverse"))
    ```
