## Commentary

For the data-driven storytelling project, my partner and I did an exhaustive analysis of the Citizen Connect initiative of the Bridge Alliance Education Fund. We offered evaluations of the quantitative measures of reach for the website as well as qualitative data on industry best practices and standards. 

We were able to recommend specific actions the organization can take to refine their work to reach more citizens in the next iteration of their service model.
