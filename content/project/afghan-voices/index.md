### Project Summary

With support from the National Science Foundation, the Human Security Lab at UMass Amherst were able to engage in a deeep study of the peace and security situation in Afghanistan under the Taliban, especially as pertains to women and gender. 20,000 survey answers were collected in Afghanistan between March and June 2022 in collaboration with global research firm RIWI, and I was honored to be part of the research team analyzing the results along with Professors Bernhard Leidner, Charli Carpenter, and Kevin Young in collaboration with a team of graduate and undergraduate students to develop an interactive website showcasing what Afghans say about the future of their country. Highlights of those results are presented here.

Additionally, the first of several publications generated from this data has been submitted and is under review, titled, 'The “First Daughter” Effect, Human Rights Advocacy and Attitudes Toward Gender Equality in Taliban-Controlled Afghanistan'.
